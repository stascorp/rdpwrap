   Contributors: "sebaxakerhtc, asmtron, affinityv, DrDrrae, saurav-biswas"
   Extra rdpwrap.ini sources can also be defined...
   
#### autoupdate.bat Options:

The goal of this project is to enable Remote Desktop Host support and concurrent RDP sessions on reduced functionality systems for home usage.

RDP Wrapper works as a layer between Service Control Manager and Terminal Services, so the original `termsrv.dll` file remains untouched. Also this method is very strong against Windows Update.

This solution was inspired by [Windows Product Policy Editor][WinPPE], big thanks to **kost** :)

### Attention:
It's recommended to have original `termsrv.dll` file with the RDP Wrapper installation. If you have modified it before with other patchers, it may become unstable and crash in any moment.

### Information:
- Source code is available, so you can build it on your own
- RDP Wrapper does not patch `termsrv.dll`, it loads `termsrv` with different parameters
- `RDPWInst` and `RDPChecker` can be redistributed without development folder and batch files
- `RDPWInst` can be used for unattended installation / deployment
- Windows 2000, XP and Server 2003 will not be supported

### Key features:
- RDP host server on any Windows edition beginning from Vista
- Console and remote sessions at the same time
- Using the same user simultaneously for local and remote logon (see configuration app)
- Up to [15 concurrent sessions](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/192) (the actual limitation depends on your hardware and OS version)
- Console and RDP session shadowing (using [Task Manager in Windows 7](http://cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/1009641577/original/remote_control.png?1413476051) and lower, and [Remote Desktop Connection in Windows 8](http://woshub.com/rds-shadow-how-to-connect-to-a-user-session-in-windows-server-2012-r2/) and higher)
- Full [multi-monitor support](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/163) for RDP host
- ...and if you find a new feature not listed here, [tell us](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/new) ;)

### Porting to other platforms:
- **ARM** for Windows RT (see links below)
- **IA-64** for Itanium-based Windows Server? *Well, I have no idea* :)

### Building the binaries:
- **x86 Delphi version** can be built with *Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010*
- **x86/x64 C++ version** can be built with *Microsoft Visual Studio 2013*

### Frequently Asked Questions

> Where can I download the installer or binaries?

In the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases) section.

> Is it legal to use this application?

There is no definitive answer, see [this discussion](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/26).

> The installer tries to access the Internet, is it normal behaviour?

Yes, it works in online mode by default. You may disable it by removing `-o` flag in the `install.bat` file.

> What is online install mode?

Online install mode introduced in version 1.6.1. When you installing RDP Wrapper first time using this mode, it will download [latest INI file](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/blob/master/res/rdpwrap.ini) from GitHub. See [this discussion](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/132).

> What is INI file and why we need it?

INI file was introduced in version 1.5. It stores system configuration for RDP Wrapper — general wrapping settings, binary patch codes, and per build specific data. When new `termsrv.dll` build comes out, developer adds support for it by updating INI file in repository.

> Config Tool reports version 1.5, but I installed higher version. What's the matter?

Beginning with version 1.5 the `rdpwrap.dll` is not updated anymore, since all settings are stored in INI file. Deal with it.

> Config Tool shows `[not supported]` and RDP doesn't work. What can I do?

Make sure you're connected to the Internet and run `update.bat`.

> Update doesn't help, it still shows `[not supported]`.

Visit [issues](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues) section, and check whether your `termsrv.dll` build is listed here. If you can't find such issue, create a new — specify your build version for adding to support.

> Why `RDPCheck` doesn't allow to change resolution and other settings?

`RDPCheck` is a very simple application and only for testing purposes. You need to use Microsoft Remote Desktop Client (`mstsc.exe`) if you want to customize the settings. You can use `127.0.0.1` or `127.0.0.2` address for loopback connection.

### Known issues:
- Beginning with Windows 8 **on tablet PCs** inactive sessions will be logged out by system - [more info](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/37)
- Beginning with Windows 10 you can accidentally lock yourself from PC - [more info](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/50)
- Beginning with the Creators Update for Windows 10 Home, RDP Wrapper will no longer work, claiming that the listener is `[not listening]` because of `rfxvmt.dll` is missing - [more info](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/194#issuecomment-323564111), [download links](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/194#issuecomment-325627235)
- Terminal Service does not start after installing some updates or "Access Denied" issue - [#215](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/215), [#101](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/101)
- RDP Wrapper does not work with RemoteFX enabled hosts - [#127](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/127), [#208](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/208), [#216](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/216)
- RDP works, but termsrv.dll crashes on logon attempt - Windows Vista Starter RTM x86 (termsrv.dll `6.0.6000.16386`)
- If Terminal Services hangs at startup, try to add **`rdpwrap.dll`** to antivirus exclusions. Also try to isolate RDP Wrapper from other shared services by the command:
<br>`sc config TermService type= own`
- RDP Wrapper can be removed by AVG Free Antivirus and [Norton Antivirus](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/191) - first make sure you downloaded [official release](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases) from GitHub, then add it to exclusions.
